        <h2>Meet Skandar and the World of Unicorn Riders</h2>
        <p>The Skandar series by A.F. Steadman is a fast-paced fantasy adventure set in a world where unicorns aren’t gentle or peaceful—they’re wild, deadly creatures bonded to humans through elemental magic. The story follows Skandar Smith, a boy who dreams of becoming a unicorn rider. When he’s unexpectedly thrust into a world of magical training, elemental battles, and hidden legacies, he must uncover the secrets of his past and master powers that even the other riders fear. Across four epic books, Skandar and his friends face villains, curses, and trials that will determine the fate of their island—and possibly the world.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Book 1:</strong> Skandar and the Unicorn Thief</li>
            <p>In the first book, Skandar finally gets the chance to fulfill his dream of bonding with a unicorn and joining the Eyrie, a hidden training ground for young riders. But when the most powerful unicorn is stolen, Skandar’s own unicorn is tied to a dangerous secret. As he trains in elemental magic with his new friends, Skandar discovers that he has the forbidden Spirit element—and that someone is willing to destroy everything to control it.</p>
            <li><strong>Book 2:</strong> Skandar and the Phantom Rider</li>
            <p>Just when Skandar starts settling into life at the Eyrie, new trouble arrives. A phantom rider is attacking bonded unicorns, and Skandar's Spirit power is once again in the spotlight. Suspicion, fear, and betrayal threaten to tear apart the riders as Skandar struggles to understand the true cost of his rare magic. To save the Island, he’ll have to trust in himself—and in his bond with his unicorn—more than ever.</p>
            <li><strong>Book 3:</strong> Skandar and the Chaos Trials</li>
            <p>With the Island’s future in question, the Chaos Trials are announced—a brutal test for all young riders that pushes their powers and friendships to the limit. As Skandar and his friends compete in the trials, dark forces begin to rise, and whispers of rebellion grow louder. The true enemy may not be who they expect, and Skandar must face the consequences of wielding power no one fully understands.</p>
            <li><strong>Book 4:</strong> Skandar and the Skeleton Curse</li>
            <p>In the darkest chapter yet, the Island is haunted by a terrifying curse that threatens to sever the bond between riders and their unicorns. As the Spirit element grows unstable, Skandar and his friends search for answers in places long forgotten. With the future of the unicorns—and the Island itself—hanging in the balance, Skandar must confront what it means to be a rider, a leader, and a protector of all elements.</p>
